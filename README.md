Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle disputes between two people. Thought to be a game of chance that depends on random luck similar to flipping coins. The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner

# Description

This Python project is an implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" where the user plays with the computer using computer vision through a machine-learning model created with Teachable-Machine.

## Milestone 1 & 2

- In the first milestone a model was exported from Teachable Machine. Teachable machine is a web tool that makes it fast and easy to create machine learning models for projects, no coding required. Train a computer to recognize images, sounds, & poses.

The model was downloaded from the tensorflow tab. keras_model.h5 and labels.txt were the teo files that were extracted onto the local device. These contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learaning model.
